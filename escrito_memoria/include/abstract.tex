%However, when one includes a particle whose mass dominates the
%potential, the numerical error accumulates and renders the integration of the
%system not reliable. This particle could be a massive black hole in a stellar
%system or a sun in a protoplanetary disc.

%% Approach: How did we go about solving or making progress on the problem?
%% =========================================================================

%In this work we present the first GPU algorithm to integrate semi-Keplerian systems
%that corrects the orbital evolution of the small bodies revolving around the most
%massive one.

%% Results: What's the answer?

%% Conclusions: What are the implications of our answer?
